INSIGHT 1 - The Lifecycle Paradox: Senior citizens exhibit an 82% subscription rate, while the 31-60 age bracket converts at only 42%. Strategy: Focus high-cost human outreach on seniors for maximum ROI.

INSIGHT 2 - Marital Liquidity Constraints: Single customers convert at 54%, whereas married customers convert the least at 43.8% despite having higher balances. Strategy: Target singles for autonomy; married households face a "conversion ceiling" due to mortgages/loans.

INSIGHT 3 - Diminishing Utility of Wealth: Mid-High balance segments ($4.7k–$10.5k) are the "sweet spot" (~60% conversion), while ultra-wealthy clients ($25k+) drop to 50%. Strategy: Prioritize mid-tier balances; wealthy clients prefer higher-yield alternatives.

INSIGHT 4 - Channel Optimization: Cellular contact yields 54% conversion, while "Unknown" methods drop to 23%. Strategy: Transitioning "Unknown" leads to mobile-first outreach could potentially double success rates in that segment.

INSIGHT 5 - The "May Effect" Fatigue: May sees the highest campaign volume but the lowest conversion (33%). Strategy: Redistribute budget to high-yield months (December/March) to avoid campaign fatigue and diminishing returns.

INSIGHT 6 - Literacy & Conversion: Tertiary education leads to the highest conversion rates. Strategy: Use simplified messaging for primary-educated segments to reduce the efficiency gap.
